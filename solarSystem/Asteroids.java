                "\n | The planetary science community refers to them as minor planets, a general term applied " +

                "\n | Most of them orbit the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, although there are groups of " +

                "\n | Asteroids come in three composition classes. C-types (chondrites) " +
                "\n | are made of clay and silicate rocks. S-types are the so-called “stony” asteroids and " +
                "\n | are made mostly of silicate rocks and nickel-iron mixtures. " +
                "\n | M-types are metallic nickel-iron. " +
